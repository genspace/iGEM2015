Questions

Is the Collaborations Complete? It looks like we present a protocol, then mention University of Michigan but that section looks incomplete.

There is 3 parts document in the Google Doc can you consolidate or tell me which one.

You said the design page was a requirement. Can you assemble the content for that? Also where would it live in the nav?  



Human Practices is still missing this section:

	Engaging with the Community Surrounding the Gowanus Canal

	One of the first questions we asked ourselves when we initiated this iGEM project was “How can we use synthetic biology to address the needs of the community living around the Gowanus Canal?”. There were several groups that we wanted to have conversations with. The Gowanus Canal is the focus of several neighborhood organizations, including the Gowanus Dredgers and the Gowanus Canal Conservancy. Although Genspace had already worked with both of these organizations during collections for the Enquete Gowanus project, we felt that our idea of a biosensor should be presented to the community for feedback, and that this was another opportunity for engagement around synthetic biology and iGEM. 



You said the design page was a requirement. Can you assemble the content for that? Also where would it live in the nav?  
Where should an image carousel of collecting samples be best placed? likewise Images of lab work processing the samples.

### Judging

One of the ways that they give us medals is by directly linking pages from our WIKI to a Judging Form. If this process is interrupted them we will not win a medal. Here is the link so you can see whats going on.

If you can please put content on these wiki pages before the others I would appreciate it. If you have any questions call me. 

I would load Atributions, collaborations, human practices, notebook and part table
