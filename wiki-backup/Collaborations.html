<h2> Collaborations</h2>

<p>
Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. We encourage you to reach out and work with other teams on difficult problems that you can more easily solve together.

<h4> Which other teams can we work with? </h4>
<p> 
You can work with any other team in the competition, including software, hardware, high school and other tracks. You can also work with non-iGEM research groups, but they do not count towards the <a hreef="http://2015.igem.org/Judging/Awards#Medals">iGEM team collaboration gold medal criterion</a>.
</p>

<p>
In order to meet the gold medal criteria on helping another team, you must complete this page and detail the nature of your collaboration with another iGEM team.
